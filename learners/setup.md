## Using Python in Jupyterhub

[Python][python] is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for
general-purpose programming as well.


For this workshop, we will use a web-based Python Environment, JupyterHub, That UCSB Letters and Science IT has setup for us: 

[Use your UCSB NETID to sing into JupyterHub](https://carpentryworkshop.lsit.ucsb.edu/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F)

If you prefer to use Python on your own computer, you may use the setup instructions below, but this is not required. 

Regardless of how you choose to install it, please make sure you have Python installed to
version 3.x (e.g., 3.10 is fine and will continue to receive security patches unitl 2026-OCT-04).

## Required Python Libraries 
The following packages are needed for this workshop: 

- Pandas
- Jupyter notebook
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Plotnine 

All packages will have been automatically installed in the Jupyterhub Instance. 

## Installing Pixi

Select your operating system from the options below.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::: solution

### Windows {#windows}

1. Open [https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/) in your web browser.

2. Under Installation, select Windows.

3. Open the Command Prompt, paste the following command, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

  ```bash
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```
  
4. Close your Command Prompt window.

::::::::::::

:::::::::::: solution

### MacOS & Linux {#macos-linux}

1. Open [https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/) in your web browser.

2. Under Installation, select "Linux & macOS".

3. Open the Terminal, paste the following command, and press <kbd>Return</kbd>.

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
  ```
  
  If your system doesn't have curl, you can use wget:
  
  ```bash
  wget -qO- https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
  ```
  
4. Close your Terminal window.

::::::::::::


## Add Python and required libraries

Now that you've installed Pixi, we can install Python, JupyterLab, and the required libraries.

1. Open your Terminal or Command Prompt. Move to your Desktop folder. There, create a new project with Pixi, which we'll call python-intro

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
pixi init python-intro
```

2. Move intro your project and add Python as a dependency of your Pixi project

```bash
cd python-intro
pixi add python
```

3. Add also JupyterLab and the other required packages

```bash
cd python-intro
pixi add jupyterlab pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Launch a Jupyter notebook

After installation, in the Terminal or Command Prompt you have open, launch a Jupyter notebook by typing this command:

```bash
pixi run jupyter lab
```

The notebook should open automatically in your browser. If it does not or you
wish to use a different browser, open this link: [http://localhost:8888](https://localhost:8888).

::: prereq :::::
## Leave terminal used to launch Jupyter open

Jupyter depends on a server running in the background associated with the window used to launch it. Closing that window will results in web interface errors in the web interface. When done, you can either close the terminal or shut down the server using <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> and submitting <kbd>y</kbd> within 5 seconds if the terminal is needed for other tasks.
